This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on developing a linear regression model for predicting housing prices using the "USA_Housing.csv" dataset. Additionally, the trained model is deployed using the Streamlit library.
## Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is developed using the "USA_Housing.csv" dataset. Key steps include data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
## Streamlit Application

The trained linear regression model is deployed using the Streamlit library. Users can input features related to a house, and the app will predict the housing price based on the trained model.
